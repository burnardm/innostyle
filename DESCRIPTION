Title: InnoRenew CoE colour palettes and ggplot themes
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Mike b.
Maintainer: Mike b. <mike.burnard@innorenew.eu>
Description: This package comes with 3 themes and 2 colour palettes.
    theme_innoLight() uses a white background with theme coloured lines and geoms.
    theme_innoBeige() uses a beige backround as in the PPT template.
    theme_innoDark() uses a beige background as in the dark PPT template.
    InnoColours() (or InnoColors()) returns InnoRenew's 5 (non-beige, non-grey)
    colours + 5 more colours, in case they are needed, as a vector. If using more
    than 5 colours, consider using some other method of organising or
    differentiating your data.
    Calling InnoColours(set="bright") returns the colours in a
    brighter tint which is more suitable for the theme_innoDark(). See associated
    help file for use details.
